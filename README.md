# Flow Developer Grants

The Developer Experience team at Flow oversees the grants program for developers. Grant projects should help accelerate and enhance the process of building and consuming apps on Flow.

## How we support you

We price and issue grants in FLOW tokens and provide feedback on milestones. The specific amount and terms are dependent on the project type, scope, and milestones.

> Note: We do not provide hands-on support as part of a grant, but if you face specific issues during development, we will do our best and try to direct you to the correct resources.

## What projects are supported?

We actively look for individuals and teams that build and maintain tools/services and produce technical content primarily targeting other builders in the ecosystem. We expect grants to result in open source contributions to existing or new repositories in the Flow ecosystem.

Below is a list of categories we aim to focus on.

> Are you looking for project ideas - or want to submit one for someone else to take on? Check out the [Requests for Proposals (RFPs)](https://github.com/onflow/developer-grants/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awishlist).

### Open source maintenance

We want to ensure that contributors can sustain their passion and commitment. Our goal is to increase recurring contributors to Flow-related repositories. For example, discussing implementation details and sending PRs to the [FCL repository](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-js).

### Developer tools and services

We want to support projects that fill ecosystem gaps by building tools and/or services. These are usually not easily monetizable, require significant resourcing, and have an outsized impact on other builders. These projects can include implementation of new and existing features, or tasks to support growth and adoption of Flow tools.

### Technical education

We want to accelerate creation of technical education material to support Flows developers. Some of these projects might require research (e.g. surveying), collaboration with builders and more.

## How to apply?

Create a new issue using the ["Grant Application"](https://github.com/onflow/developer-grants/issues/new?assignees=alxflw&labels=in+review&template=grant-application.md&title=) issue template. Make sure to fill out all the details!

### How are applications evaluated?

We are using the [DVF framework](https://tryble.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/prioritizr/pages/254738466/Design+Thinking+Desirability+Viability+and+Feasibility+DVF) to determine how relevant a project is. Specifically, we are looking for:

- A clear problem statement: What is the evidence showing that it is worth tackling?
- Technical feasibility and track records of contributors: How likely would this be completed as planned?
- Impact to the ecosystem: In what ways does this enrich or accelerate other projects?

### Who is evaluating them?

Grant proposals are reviewed and approved by the Developer Grant Committee (DGC). The committee consists of individuals who know the funding priorities of the Flow ecosystem.

### What happens after the application submission?

The DGC reviews all applications on an ongoing basis. Upon review, we will contact you directly with more questions or next steps.
